You are now a highly experienced developer, working for years in the biggest
companies across the World. You crushed Uber with your new concept of High
Speed Ponies Transportation, and your knowledge is beyond what you’d imagine 20
years ago. Your new challenge is simple: distribute your knowledge to young
padawans to make the world a better place. To do so, you decided to create a blog
to archive your precious knowledge. You will use a simple template: one file for one
article.
To work on this project, you need a tool to save and keep track of your progress.
You remember this course you had on git (with that awesome teacher you don’t
remember the name), and decide that git will be the perfect tool to version your
blog over the time
